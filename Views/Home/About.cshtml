                <p>The Diving Centre Rhodes was established and built in 2017 by using local stone and natural materials. It includes all the necessary infrastructures for the excellent service for all our scuba divers such as showers, a comfortable waiting room, show room for diving equipment, W.C with wheelchair access and we have built it especially to provide easy access for people with mobility difficulties/wheelchair. Our facilities include a classroom, fully equipped with up to date audiovisual for the theoretical diving courses while practical courses for beginners and children will take place in a secure aquatic environment or in the swimming pool. We also have specialist courses designed for people with disabilities (approved by DDI – Disabled Divers International).</p>
